-- dbmodel.sql

-- This is the file where you are describing the database schema of your game
-- Basically, you just have to export from PhpMyAdmin your table structure and copy/paste
-- this export here.
-- Note that the database itself and the standard tables ("global", "stats", "gamelog" and "player") are
-- already created and must not be created here

-- Note: The database schema is created from this file when the game starts. If you modify this file,
--       you have to restart a game to see your changes in database.




-- Example 2: add a custom field to the standard "player" table
-- ALTER TABLE `player` ADD `player_my_custom_field` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `board` (
